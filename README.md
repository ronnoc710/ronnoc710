- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Connor, a self taught web developer. I live in Detroit, MI with my two cats, Winston and Magnolia. I currently work part time as a pet sitter and Door Dash driver which allows me spare time to study or work on projects as well as enough free time to cook my meals and be a loving cat dad.
- ðŸ‘€ I am proficient in using the CLI and Git, and have worked extensively in JavaScript, Python, and C#. I have developed web apps in React.js and am comfortable using JavaScript libraries to improve my projects. I am consistantly striving to write code that is clean, correct, and efficient.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning algorithm design and applications of OOP principles and patterns as well as create full-stack projects to showcase in my portfolio.
